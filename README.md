# web-scraping-challenge

- The jupyter notebook file titled, "mission_to_mars.ipynb" was used to scrape data. This was accomplished by using BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests/Splinter.

- The jupyter notebook was then converted into a python script, titled "scrape_mars.py". This file included a function called scrape that executed the scraping code from above. 

- A template html titled, "index.html" was created to take the mars data that was scraped and collected (by running "app.py") to display on a webpage (which is incomplete at the moment, and needs to be updated).
